### Hello employers, fellow students, or curious programmers! ðŸ‘‹

I created this github page to document my code in the event my physical hardrives fail, my student
account closes, or I do something silly. I do not currently have all of my coursework available, but I am 
working on it!

In terms of jobs, I am currently interested in:
- Software Engineering
- Data Science/Machine Learning Engineering/Research
- Aerospace Engineering
- Cyber Security/Ethical Hacking
- Financial Modeling
- Anything space!
- Anything that may be interesting, fun, or enlightening!
