### Hello employers or students! ðŸ‘‹

As of May 2022, I am a mathematics graduate of Salisbury University in Salisbury, MD. I have spent several years building my knowledge of computer science, machine learning and mathematics, and I am now entering the software engineering industry! Please feel free to explore my repositories, but if it is for class, I do not recommend copying! Use it for reference, as it will only hurt you and your success in the future.

Enjoy!
